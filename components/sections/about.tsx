				<p>
					I’m a software engineer who loves crafting clean, intuitive interfaces
					that merge thoughtful design with solid engineering. My favorite
					projects sit right at the intersection of creativity and logic —
					turning ideas into smooth, engaging digital experiences that just feel
					right to use.
				</p>
				<p>
					I specialize in building products with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and
					React Native, often focusing on performance, maintainability, and
					great user experience. I enjoy designing reusable components, refining
					interactions, and writing code that balances efficiency with clarity.
					Collaboration is a big part of my process — working closely with
					designers and backend teams to bring concepts to life from sketch to
					screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of work, I’m a creative at heart. I draw, paint, and often
					find inspiration in music, movies, and animation. Whether it’s
					sketching ideas or fine-tuning pixels, I’m always exploring new ways
					to blend art and technology into meaningful, well-crafted experiences.
